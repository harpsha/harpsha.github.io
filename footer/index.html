    <h2>A new approach to Digital Marketing</h2>
    <p>
        Your customers are evolving and growing, but your digital marketing activities probably aren&rsquo;t. Many companies are 
        still only using Facebook and Twitter to engage with their audience, but is that enough? We believe that mixing the 
        Digital and Physical worlds offers brands a unique new way of connecting with their customers on a deeper level. 
        We&rsquo;ve proven that this helps drive engagement - we&rsquo;ve seen a 22% increase in enquiries as a direct result of our latest campaign. 
        <br><br>
        What follows is a summary of how we designed and built our latest Digital Marketing campaign, Sid, and how we could do this for you.

            We quietly launched Sid on 20th November with just a couple of tweets and before we knew it the traffic started to pour in. 
            Players were submitting Sid to some of the big news sites like Reddit and Hacker News. Fast Company tweeted a link to their 
            936,000 followers and traffic surged again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            People started creating YouTube videos about Sid and we even had players set up Twitter accounts just so they could Tweet their score. 
            We don&rsquo;t like to use the phrase &lsquo;viral marketing&rsquo; too loosely, however traffic to our site grew and grew without us doing any other 
            digital marketing. Some would say that&rsquo;s viral marketing...
